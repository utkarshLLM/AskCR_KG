These crashes have been responsible for 17&nbsp;injuries and one death.&nbsp;As part of the investigation, the agency is requesting information from Tesla regarding the operation of Autopilot, including how the software has changed over time, and how the system is designed to prevent misuse. According to a letter sent to Tesla by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Aug. 31, 2021, the probe will examine how Tesla’s Autopilot system operates, including how it identifies and reacts to obstacles in the road. But the agency is also evaluating how Autopilot assists and monitors drivers, and how it keeps them engaged with the task of operating the vehicle—a focus that Consumer Reports’ experts and others say is increasingly necessary as automated steering and speed control systems become more prevalent on new vehicles.',\n",

But with the market shift toward SUVs, there are fewer small cars to choose from. You may question what a small car is and what the best small car is. CR considers both subcompact and compact cars to be small cars. We break our ratings into those subcategories to make it easy for members to find the best small car. Some brands—including Ford, General Motors, and Toyota—have moved away from small cars, instead creating new hatchback models to take their place, often with SUV-inspired styling and increased interior space. Cars that have continued through the years, like the Honda Civic and Mazda3, have increased in size, often boasting the rear-seat room and amenities you might have expected in a midsized car a few years ago. Because of this ongoing vehicular evolution, we have consolidated our small car buying advice and ratings into an area that combines sedans and hatchbacks. The differences between these car types aren’t as distinct as they once were, and this provides car shoppers with a more complete picture, including what is available within their budget. Go to the sedans and hatchbacks buying guide.',\n",

But with the market shift toward SUVs, there are fewer small cars to choose from. You may question what a small car is and what the best small car is. CR considers both subcompact and compact cars to be small cars. We break our ratings into those subcategories to make it easy for members to find the best small car. Some brands—including Ford, General Motors, and Toyota—have moved away from small cars, instead creating new hatchback models to take their place, often with SUV-inspired styling and increased interior space. Cars that have continued through the years, like the Honda Civic and Mazda3, have increased in size, often boasting the rear-seat room and amenities you might have expected in a midsized car a few years ago. Because of this ongoing vehicular evolution, we have consolidated our small car buying advice and ratings into an area that combines sedans and hatchbacks. The differences between these car types aren’t as distinct as they once were, and this provides car shoppers with a more complete picture, including what is available within their budget.

It requires technical understanding of how airflow and system components interact.', 'This advice is based on professional recommendations and technical insights. It suggests a specific action—measuring static pressure—that requires expertise and can help consumers make informed decisions about filter compatibility with their HVAC systems.', 'This is a value assessment and professional recommendation that balances cost, performance, and safety. It provides a practical guideline for consumers who may not have the means to measure static pressure but still want to ensure their system operates efficiently.']\n",

            "Reasoning: ['This advice is crucial because installing the filter in the wrong direction can significantly reduce its effectiveness, leading to poor air quality and potential damage to the HVAC system. The arrows on the filter frame are a technical detail that many consumers might overlook without expert guidance.', 'This insight helps consumers prepare for the installation process by suggesting that while tools might be necessary, they often are not. This can save time and effort, especially for those who might not have tools readily available. It reflects an understanding of the variability in HVAC systems.', 'This simplifies the installation process for consumers, reducing potential intimidation or hesitation about replacing filters themselves. It provides reassurance that the task is generally straightforward, which can encourage regular maintenance and improve system performance.']\n",

Avoid using more specific terms like \\'mathematician\\' or \\'scientist\\'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs.
